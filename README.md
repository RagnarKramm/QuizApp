# QuizApp
Quiz app made as an exam in a C# course, the CRUD pages were generated with MVC Razor Pages.
For the database Microsoft SQL Server was used, database entities and relations were generated using Entity Framework Core.

The task was to make a Quiz Web App where users can create quizzes with questions that either have one correct answer or have no correct answers.
So the quizzes could be used for two functions- asking questions related to knowledge or to gather information(polls).
Users can answer quizzes made by others or themselves. After the quiz was answered the user got feedback on how well they answered questions with a correct answer or overview on the answers they chose on a poll question.
